	   <h3>
		A rainy day fund, a.k.a. an <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergency_fund.asp" target="_blank">
	    	emergency fund</a> is a savings account established for one purpose -
	    	to weather a financial disaster, e.g. the loss of your job,
		unexpected medical expenses, a much-needed car repair, etc.
	   </h3>

	   <h3>
		If you are
	    	<a href="https://www.creditdonkey.com/average-american-savings-statistics.html" target="_blank" >
		like many Americans</a>, you are not financially prepared for tough times.
	    	Without the cushion of an emergency fund, you increase the likelihood of abusing
	    	credit cards, missing important payments, prematurely tapping retirement accounts and
	    	eventual bankruptcy.
	   </h3>

	   <h3>
		Financial planners often recommend having an emergency fund that can cover
	    	3-6 months of expenses. This can seem like quite a lot, a near impossible goal
	    	- but knowing the basics of an emergency and what it takes
		to fund one is a solid first step toward better personal finance
	    	and peace of mind.

		1. Assumptions - Just basic info to get things started.<br/><br/>
		2. Expenses - Listing out your monthly expenses to determine the proper size
	    	   of your emergency fund and get a clear picture of your
	    	   financial obligations.  <br/><br/>
		3. Savings Plan - See how long it would take to fund your emergency fund,
	    	   and experiment with how much you want to save each month to reach your goal.
